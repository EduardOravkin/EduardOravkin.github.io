        <p>It was <a href='https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/71128'>estimated</a> that in 1998, 11 million people in the US had a stroke, while only 770 thousand had symptoms. 
          It is often the case that stroke has either no or mild symptoms. Therefore, people often do not realize they are having a stroke and seek help very late. 
          Calling an ambulance as fast as possible is essential in preventing brain damage. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The symptoms of minor stroke often include a slight facial paralysis on one side of the face. 
          Our algorithm detects this paralysis from a photo, by being trained on data of people who suffered a stroke. 
          When one is experiencing minor stroke, and is not sure about it, this app may save them crucial time before they call an ambulance

        <h2>Krpáčovo Park</h2>
        <p>Real estate project of 15 recreational chalets in the Slovak mountains. Cofounded with brother and a friend. See <a href='https://krpacovopark.com'>krpacovopark.com</a>.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 has caused a huge increase in within-country tourism because of difficulties to travel abroad. 
          This generated high demand for recreational real estate in some parts of Slovakia. 
          This project was started in September 2020, in the hope of meeting this demand. 
          We offer 15 recreational chalets with 228 sq.m. of gross floor area for sale. 
          Each chalet includes a dining area, large terrace, sauna, exterior wooden whirpool, fireplace and 3-4 double bedrooms. 
          13 km away from the best ski resort in Slovakia.</p>
