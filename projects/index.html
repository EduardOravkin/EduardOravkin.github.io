          <p>Most cyclists train based on training procedures designed for a general cyclist. 
            However, each athlete is different and hence distinct training regimes influence their performance in different ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            OptiCycle analyzes perosnal training and race data, and allows the athlete to adapt their training procedures to what fits them best.
            Therefore, the cyclist is able to personalize their training regime. This is a work in collaboration with the Slovak Federation of Cyclists.

        <p>Machine learning solution to detect stroke from facial expression.</p>

        <p>It was <a href='https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/71128'>estimated</a> that in 1998, 11 million people in the US had a stroke, while only 770 thousand had symptoms. 
          It is sometimes the case that stroke has either no or mild symptoms. Therefore, people often seek help very late when experiencing stroke. 
          Calling an ambulance as fast as possible is essential in preventing brain damage. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The symptoms of minor stroke often include a slight facial paralysis on one side of the face. 
          Our algorithm detects this paralysis from a photo, by being trained on data of people who suffered a stroke. 
          When one is experiencing minor stroke, and is not sure about it, this app may save them crucial time by calling an ambulance earlier.

      <p>
        Most friendly football games are still organized through Messenger and WhatsApp groups, organizers spend countless hours chasing people who forgot to pay, 
        and it is usually very difficult to get hold of a football pitch owner to book a game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ballers is an app which solves all of the above problems. Chat, pitch booking and money collection all in one. The app is due to launch in 2022.

        <h2>Krpáčovo Park</h2>
        <p>Real estate project of 15 recreational chalets in the Slovak mountains. Cofounded with brother and a friend. See <a href='https://krpacovopark.com'>krpacovopark.com</a>.</p>
        <img src="../imgs/chalet_image.jpg" id="chalet_image" alt='image of chalet in Krpáčovo Park' style="width: 100vw; min-width: 140px; max-width: 100%"/>
        <p>COVID-19 has caused a large increase in within-country tourism in Slovakia because of difficulties to travel abroad. 
          This generated high demand for recreational real estate. 
          Krpáčovo Park is a project that was started in September 2020, in the hope of meeting this demand. 
          We offer 15 recreational chalets with 228 sq.m. of gross floor area for sale. 
          Each chalet includes a dining area, large terrace, sauna, exterior wooden whirpool, fireplace and 3-4 double bedrooms. 
          13 km away from the best ski resort in Slovakia.</p>
